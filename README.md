# smartParkingSystem_1.0
Firebase realtime database based IoT car smart parking system

Embedded system that, by using and communicating microcontrollers (ATMEL328P and Tensilica L106),
sensors (Ultrasonic HC-SR04) and visual indicators (LEDS), provide assistance in
the parking process of the cars.

## List of components

* NodeMCU "Amica" (CP2102 USB to UART Bridge)
* Arduino Nano (ATMEL328P)
* Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
* Stepper motor 28BYJ-48 (with breakout board - ULN2003APG IC)
* Tri-color leds
* Power supply with an output of 5V-3A

Future Work: Add a touch display for better visualization of the places in the parking lot.
