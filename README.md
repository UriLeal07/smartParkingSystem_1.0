# smartParkingSystem_1.0
Firebase realtime database based IoT car smart parking system

Embedded system that, by using and communicating microcontrollers (ATMEL328P and Tensilica L106),
sensors (Ultrasonic HC-SR04) and visual indicators (Nextion Display, LEDS), provide assistance in
the parking process of the cars.

List of components:

* 1. NodeMCU "Amica" (CP2102 USB to UART Bridge)
* 2. Arduino Nano (ATMEL328P)
* 3. Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
* 4. Stepper motor 28BYJ-48 (with breakout board - ULN2003APG IC)
* 5. 3.2" Nextion touch display (NX4024T032_011)
* 6. Tri-color leds
* 7. Power supply with an output of 5V-3A
